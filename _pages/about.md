My name is Michael Butros and I am the Director of Education at the Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4OPT) at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech). My involvement with AI4OPT began in Summer 2022 as a participant in the first cohort of the Faculty Training Program (FTP) offered through the institute to train faculty in Data Science techniques.

Before joining AI4OPT, I was a professor of physics and mathematics at Victor Valley College (VVC), a two-year community college in Southern California, between 2000-2024. As a professor I was interested in the use of technology and computation in the introductory physics and mathematics courses. I also used Mastery Grading, Peer Instruction, Inquiry Based Learning, and Flipped Classrooms techniques. While at VVC, I served as the chair of Physics Department, the VVC Physics Club Advisor, and the Society of Physics Students Chapter Advisor.
